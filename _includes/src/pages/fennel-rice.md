From _The New York Times_.

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 medium fennel bulbs, trimed, cored and diced small
- salt to taste
- 1 cup long grain rice, or coarse bulgur
- 2 1/2 cups water
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
- freshly ground pepper

## Method
Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a pan or wide lidded saucepan. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in fennel, add a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until fennel
has wilted and softened (about 8 minutes). Stir in rice or bulgur to coat with olive oil.

Add water, salt, pepper, parsley and dill and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until rice or bulgur is soft and liquid absorbed (i.e. normal absorption cooking time for the rice).

Remove from heat, uncover and place a towl across the top of the pan. Return lid and let sit for 10 minutes.

Serve hot, with the remaining olive oil drizzled over the top.
