## Spectrum PI
This character set is based on the ZX Spectrum system font, but extended to cover the [ASCII OEM character set]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437). The original Spectrum font has a light airy feel, but there are a few awkward characters and some that are hard to distinguish (e.g. W and V). Some of its quirks (blocky X and period) are what give the typeface its character, so I've left those unchanged.

You can download a copy as a [.chr file](https://parkimminent.com/media/bin/spectrum-pi.chr) for [Nasu](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nasu.html).

## Foul Airs
__A deadly sickness has fallen upon your kingdom. At the behest of your council, you remain isolated in your chambers.__

I made this game in 10-12 hours over two days for the [[https://itch.io/jam/merveilles-hyperjam/entries:][Merveilles Hyperjam]]. My first game jam and I guess it's the only game I ever 'released'.

# Energy
"Moreover, within a lifetime of people born just after the Second World War the rate had more than tripled, from about 10 to 34 GJ/capita between 1950 and 2020. Translating the last rate into more readily imaginable equivalents, it is as if an average Earthling has every year at their personal disposal about 800 kilograms (0.8 tons, or nearly six barrels) of crude oil, or about 1.5 tons of good bituminous coal. And when put in terms of physical labor, it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be, depending on the specific country, mostly between 200 and 240. On average, humans now have unprecedented amounts of energy at their disposal." - How the World Really Works by Vaclac Smil
