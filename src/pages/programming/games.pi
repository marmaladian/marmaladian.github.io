  These are some small games I made.
2 Foul Airs
  __A deadly sickness has fallen upon your kingdom. At the behest of your council, you remain isolated in your chambers.__

  I made this game in 10-12 hours over two days for the [[https://itch.io/jam/merveilles-hyperjam/entries:][Merveilles Hyperjam]].
  My first game jam and I guess it's the only game I ever 'released'.

  A PuzzleScript game I made at a contract job once. Not very interesting, but linked here for posterity.
