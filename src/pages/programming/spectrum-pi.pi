  This character set is based on the ZX Spectrum system font, but extended to cover the
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437][ASCII OEM character set]].
  The original Spectrum font has a light airy feel, but there are a few awkward characters and some that
  are hard to distinguish (e.g. W and V). Some of its quirks (blocky X and period) are what give the typeface
  its character, so I've left those unchanged.
