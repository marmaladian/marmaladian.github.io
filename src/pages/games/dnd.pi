  Never played D&D as a kid and didn't really understand what it was. More recently I had a crack at building my own campaign
  __Second Spring__. After realising what an undertaking that actually was, decided to run the colossally large
  __Out of the Abyss__ campaign.
  
  As you read this, the Triceratops Prudential lads are still stuck in the abyss. I really should run another session.
