This site was inspired by Arne's [Android Arts](http://androidarts.com), cly5m's [autofish](http://autofish.net) and Devine Lu Linvega's [XXIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com) - sites that are continually added to and pruned away, gradually building up a fascinating repository of their thoughts, art and explorations. I've since heard the term digital garden used to describe this sort of site and like it very much.

The site is completely static and the pages are generated from text files using Python. It has previously been written in [m4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)), C, Java and I think the original was Ruby.

The name __Park Imminent__ comes from a fictional megacorp/zaibatsu I invented for a cyberpunk roleplaying game â€” a Korean-owned advanced technologies corporation... "Your future is our present."
