I play Minecraft occasionally with a friend on a shared server called _The Land of Make Believe_.

## Coordinates
Mesa City (1470, 80, -3540) (185, 63, -450 nether)
Alexandria (-330, 80,  -740) (-52, 77, -124 nether)

## Building notes
Current tower: cylinder is 12 radius, the ellipsoid on top is 14 (i.e. would be a 28 block sphere, but I'm using half-slabs). I've just built level 18, so the next is 19.

## Building reference and inspiration
- [@swordself_mc](https://www.instagram.com/swordself_mc/?hl=en) is a good reference for block colour ramps and simply decorated buildings.
- [Plotz Modeller](https://www.plotz.co.uk/) â€” a tool for generating ellipsoids and other shapes.
