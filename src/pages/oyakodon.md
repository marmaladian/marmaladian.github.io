To prepare the dashi, soak shiitake and kombu in water for 2+ hours. Keep liquid. Eat the kombu.

Mix milk, miso paste, starch, turmeric and black salt together and set aside.

Chop onion, abura-age, oyster mushroom and shiitake.

Pour the dashi into a pan over medium heat and add sugar, sake, mirin and soy sauce. Stir to combine and dissolve the sugar then add the onion. Cook for 5 minutes then add the abura-age, oyster mushroom and shiitake. When bubbling, add the silken tofu, breaking it up by stirring it gently through. Cook for 5 minutes/

Add the milk mixture and stir through, cook for another 5 minutes and then serve over rice. Garnish with spring onion.
