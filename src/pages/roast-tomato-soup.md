This recipe is by Donna Hay.

## Ingredients
- 12 large vine-ripened tomatoes (2kg)
- 1 whole garlic head, unpeeled
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cups chicken/vegetable stock (750mL)
- 2-3 tsp sugar
- salt and black pepper

## Method
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Place the tomatoes (halved) and garlic on two baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 40 minutes or until very soft. Allow to cool slightly.

Squeeze the garlic flesh from its skin and process in a blender with the tomatoes and any juice from the baking trays in two batches until smooth. Cook the tomato mixture, stock and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Serves 4–6.
