    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The weights here are relative to the water - e.g. if you have 100g of water, then you need 160g of buckwheat flour and 40g of wheat flour.</p>
<ul>
<li>160 % buckwheat flour</li>
<li>40 % wheat flour</li>
<li>100 % water</li>
<li>tapioca flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Mix flours and water in bowl with your fingers until a stiff crumbly dough is formed. Knead until smooth then turn out onto a surface that has been lightly dusted with tapioca flour.</p>
<p>Shape into a cone then press down so you have a thick coin with a flat bottom. Use a rolling pin to roll into a flat sheet, longer in one direction than the other.</p>
<p>Dust the top with more tapioca flour and then fold the sheet in half across its width. Dust the top with tapioca flour and fold again.</p>
<p>Use a sharp knife to cut the folded sheet into folded noodles.</p>
<p>Get a large bowl of iced water ready. To cook, drop the noodles into a pot of rapidly boiling water for 60 seconds. Might need a little longer if your noodles are thick. Lift them out (using a strainer or cooking chopsticks) and drop them into the iced water.</p>
<p>Serve with kombu dashi (a broth), soy, sliced spring onions and shichimi togarashi (a pepper/spice mix)... or whatever you like.</p>
