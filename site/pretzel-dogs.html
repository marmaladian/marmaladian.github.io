</div>   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
<li>1.5 cups warm water</li> <li>1 tbsp sugar</li> <li>2 tsp salt</li> <li>2.25 tbsp active dry yeast</li> <li>4.5 cups plain flour</li> <li>2 tbsp vegan butter, melted</li> <li>12 veggie hot dogs</li> <li>1 cup warm water</li> <li>1 tbsp vegan butter, melted</li> </ul>
 <h2>Method</h2>
 <p>Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture begins to foam.</p>
 <p>Add the flour and margarine and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined.</p>
 <p>Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
 <p>Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil.</p>
 <p>Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
 <p>Preheat your oven to 220Â°C. Once the dough has risen, pinch off golf-ball-sized pieces and roll them into 12-inch ropes. You might want to flour your hands and the surface you're rolling on because this dough is sticky.</p>
 <p>Wrap each veggie dog in the dough and place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.</p>
 <p>Mix warm water and baking soda together. Brush each wrapped dog with this mixture and then bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>
 <p>Brush each baked dog with melted margarine and sprinkle with kosher salt.</p>
