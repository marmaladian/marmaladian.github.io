</p>
<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>1.5 cups warm water
</li>
<li>1 tbsp sugar
</li>
<li>2 tsp salt
</li>
<li>2.25 tbsp active dry yeast
</li>
<li>4.5 cups plain flour
</li>
<li>2 tbsp vegan butter, melted
</li>
<li>12 veggie hot dogs
</li>
<li>1 cup warm water
</li>
<li>1 tbsp vegan butter, melted
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle yeast on top.
</p>
<p>Allow to sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture begins to foam.
</p>
<p>Add the flour and margarine and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes,
</p>
<p>or until the dough has doubled in size.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 220°C. Once the dough has risen, pinch off golf-ball-sized pieces and roll them
</p>
<p>into 12-inch ropes. You might want to flour your hands and the surface you're rolling on because this dough is sticky.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Wrap each veggie dog in the dough and place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Mix warm water and baking soda together. Brush each wrapped dog with this mixture and then bake for 10 minutes,
</p>
<p>or until golden brown.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Brush each baked dog with melted margarine and sprinkle with kosher salt.
