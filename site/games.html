<h2>Foul Airs
</h2>
<p><i>A deadly sickness has fallen upon your kingdom. At the behest of your council, you remain isolated in your chambers.</i>
</p>
<p>I made this game in 10-12 hours over two days for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/merveilles-hyperjam/entries:">Merveilles Hyperjam</a>. My first game jam and I guess it's the only game I ever 'released'.

<h2>Sign Off
