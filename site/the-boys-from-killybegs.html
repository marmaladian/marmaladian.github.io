       <h1>The Boys from Killybegs</h1>
 <p>I learnt this song from a high school maths teacher - he had a band playing Scottish and Irish folk songs, and I bought a copy of the cassette for my parents. I haven't heard a better version yet, but sadly the tape wore through years ago.</p>
 <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <p>There are wild and rocky hills on the coast of Donegal</p>
 <p>And her fishermen are hardy, brave and free</p>
 <p>And the big Atlantic swell is a thing they know right well</p>
 <p>As they fight to take a living from the sea</p>
 <h3>Chorus</h3>
 <p><em>With a pleasant rolling sea and the herring running free</em></p>
 <p><em>And the fleet go riding gently through the foam</em></p>
 <p><em>When the boats are loaded down, there'll be singing in the town</em></p>
 <p><em>When the boys of Killybegs come rolling home</em></p>
 <p>.</p>
 <p>Well, you don your rubber boots and you've got your oilskins on</p>
 <p>And you check your gear to see that it's okay</p>
 <p>And your jumper keeps you warm, for it's cold before the dawn</p>
 <p>Then you're ready to begin another day</p>
 <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
 <p>Now, you're headed out to sea and the wind is blowing free </p>
 <p>And you cast your nets as rain begins to fall</p>
 <p>But, the sun comes riding high and the clouds will soon roll by</p>
 <p>And today you'll maybe take a bumper haul</p>
 <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
 <p>When the weather's blowing rough, then the work is very tough</p>
 <p>And the ropes will raise the welts upon your hands</p>
 <p>But you'll never leave the sea, for whoever you may be</p>
 <p>When it's in your blood, it's hard to live on land</p>
 <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
 <p>Oh, there's purple on the hills and there's green down by the shore</p>
 <p>And the sun has spilled his gold upon the sea</p>
 <p>And there's silver down below, where the herring fishes go</p>
 <p>When we catch them, we'll have gold for you and me</p>
 <p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>
