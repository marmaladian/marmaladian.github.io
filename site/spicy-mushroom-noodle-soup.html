                    <h1>Spicy noodle soup with mushrooms and herbs</h1>
                    <section>
                        <p>This recipe is by Alison Roman and comes from the NYT (<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020122-spicy-noodle-soup-with-mushrooms-and-herbs">link</a>).
</p>
<p>It is incredibly rich and savoury, and works with pretty much any vegetables or noodles you want to throw in.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<p>canola or olive oil, garlic, shallots or onion, salt and pepper, mixed mushrooms, fresh chillies, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, noodles, soft herbs (parsley, coriander, etc.), sesame seeds, sesame oil.
</p>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Heat <b>3 tablespoons oil</b> in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
</p>
<p>Add <b>4 thinly sliced garlic cloves</b> and <b> 2 large thinly sliced shallots</b>, and season with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p>Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots start to turn a nice golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
</p>
<p>Add <b>500g mixed mushrooms</b> and a <b>thinly sliced chilli</b>, and season with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have softened, released much of their water and turned a deep golden brown,
</p>
<p>10 to 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>Add <b>1/2 cup soy sauce</b>, <b>Â¼ cup vinegar</b> and <b>8 cups of water</b>. Bring to a gentle simmer and season with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p>Continue to simmer until the flavors have melded and the broth tastes good enough to drink, 15 to 20 minutes.
</p>
<p>Season with more soy sauce and vinegar as you like.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cook <b>250g noodles</b> in a large pot of salted boiling water until just al dente.
</p>
<p>Add the noodles to the pot with the broth, and let them hang out in there for a minute or two to finish cooking and soak up all that flavor.
</p>
<p>To serve, use tongs to divide the noodles and mushrooms among bowls, then ladle the hot broth over the top.
</p>
<p>Serve with another <b>sliced chilli</b>, <b>2 cups of soft herbs</b> and <b>sesame seeds</b> and <b>sesame oil</b> for people to dress their own bowls to their liking.
