                    <h1>Swede gnocchi with cavolo nero</h1>
                    <section>
                        <p>I've had a few butter and sage gnocchi dishes, but cavolo nero is often for sale at our local market.
</p>
<p>It might be better to remove the stems entirely and cut the leaves into smaller pieces, but I didn't want to waste any.
</p>
<p>Both ways will be fine.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>2 medium size swedes
</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil
</li>
<li>plain flour
</li>
<li>2 tsp chilli flakes
</li>
<li>2 tbsp vegan parmesan cheese
</li>
<li>20-30 cavolo nero leaves with stalks
</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegan butter
</li>
<li>salt & pepper
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Wash and cut the cavolo nero into 10cm pieces then set aside.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 220&deg;C (200&deg;C fan forced). Peel and cut the swede into small cubes, place in a baking dish and stir
</p>
<p>through oil. Bake in oven for 50 minutes or until soft. Remove from oven and reduce oven heat to 100&deg;C.
</p>
<p>Allow to cool slightly, then mash or blend into a pulp. Add chilli, parmesan and season.
</p>
<p>Add enough flour to form a sticky dough, then roll into long snakes on a lightly floured bench.
</p>
<p>The snakes should be about thumb thickness. Cut into inch long pieces.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Place gnocchi into a saucepan of boiling water, working in batches. When they rise to the surface, remove them to a plate.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Fry the gnocchi in a pan with a little oil, turning to brown both sides, then transferring to a tray
</p>
<p>in the oven to keep warm.
</p>
<p>Heat the butter in the fry pan until sizzling, then fry the cavolo nero pieces, stirring occasionally until most
</p>
<p>of the leaves have started to crisp. Return the gnocchi to the pan, add a splash of balsamic vinegar and stir
</p>
<p>through before serving.
