                    <section>
                        <p>This character set is based on the ZX Spectrum system font, but extended to cover the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">ASCII OEM character set</a>. The original Spectrum font has a light airy feel, but there are a few awkward characters and some that are hard to distinguish (e.g. W and V). Some of its quirks (blocky X and period) are what give the typeface its character, so I've left those unchanged.
