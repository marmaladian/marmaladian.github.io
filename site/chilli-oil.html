                    <h1>Chilli oil</h1>
                    <section>
                        <p>This recipe is from <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/how-to-make-chili-oil">Omnivore's Cookbook</a>.
</p>
<p>It works very well in some dishes, but for others the five spice and sesame are overwhelming.
</p>
<p>I'll keep messing with this one.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>4 tbsp Sichuan chilli flakes
</li>
<li>2 tbsp five spice
</li>
<li>3 tbsp toasted white sesame seeds
</li>
<li>1 tsp ground Sichuan peppercorns
</li>
<li>1 star anise
</li>
<li>2 bay leaves
</li>
<li>1 cup peanut or other vegetable oil
</li>
<li>thin slice of fresh ginger
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Place all ingredients in a heat proof bowl (not a thin ceramic or glass one). I place the bowl in the sink just
</p>
<p>in case of an accident. Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl. Heat the cup of oil with the ginger in it,
</p>
<p>until the ginger fries and turns golden brown - this is about 180-90 degrees.
</p>
<p>Carefully pour the oil into the bowl over the spices and stir with a metal spoon. Once cool,
</p>
<p>remove the bay leaves and star anise, then store in a clean class jar or bottle. It will keep a long time in
</p>
<p>the fridge, or a few weeks at room temperature.
