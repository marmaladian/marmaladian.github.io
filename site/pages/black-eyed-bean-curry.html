My friend Ryan described it as a revelation, &#8220;it&#8217;s as though I&#8217;ve never eaten beans before&#8221;.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 cup dried black-eyed beans</li>
<li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
<li>vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
<li>1 tsp ginger paste</li>
<li>1/2 tsp turmeric paste</li>
<li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
<li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
<li>400mL coconut cream</li>
<li>vegetable stock cube</li>
<li>bunch of chopped parsley</li>
<li>lemon or lime to serve</li>
</ul>

<p>You can soak the dried beans in cold water overnight, but it&#8217;s quicker to put them in a saucepan with 2.5L of cold water, bring to a boil and then turn off and soak for 4 hours before rinsing.</p>

<p>Grating the ginger, garlic and turmeric is easiest with a Japanese ceramic grater, a microplane, box grater or even finely mincing them will also work.</p>

<p>Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry until sweating and softened.</p>

<p>Stir through the pastes, oregano, chilli and curry powder and cook for a minute or two. Add the beans, stir through to coat with the onion and spices then mix through the coconut cream.</p>

<p>Cook for 10-15 minutes then stir through the parsley and season to taste. Serve with citrus.</p>
