    <nav><a href="index.html">Park Imminent</a></nav><h1>About</h1><p>This site was inspired by Arne&#8217;s <a href="http://androidarts.com">Android Arts</a>, cly5m&#8217;s <a href="http://autofish.net">autofish</a> and Devine Lu Linvega&#8217;s <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com">XXIIVV</a> - sites that are continually added to and pruned away, gradually building up a fascinating repository of their thoughts, art and explorations. I&#8217;ve since heard the term digital garden used to describe this sort of site and like it very much.</p>

<p>The site is completely static and the pages are generated from text files using Python. It has previously been written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">m4</a>, C, Java and I think the original was Ruby.</p>

<p>The name <strong>Park Imminent</strong> comes from a fictional megacorp/zaibatsu I invented for a cyberpunk roleplaying game â€” a Korean-owned advanced technologies corporation&#8230; &#8220;Your future is our present.&#8221;</p>
