<p>Mix flours and water in bowl with your fingers until a stiff crumbly dough is formed. Knead until smooth then turn out onto a surface that has been lightly dusted with tapioca flour.</p>

<p>Shape into a cone then press down so you have a thick coin with a flat bottom. Use a rolling pin to roll into a flat sheet, longer in one direction than the other.</p>

<p>Dust the top with more tapioca flour and then fold the sheet in half across its width. Dust the top with tapioca flour and fold again.</p>

<p>Use a sharp knife to cut the folded sheet into folded noodles.</p>

<p>Get a large bowl of iced water ready. To cook, drop the noodles into a pot of rapidly boiling water for 60 seconds. Might need a little longer if your noodles are thick. Lift them out (using a strainer or cooking chopsticks) and drop them into the iced water.</p>

<p>Serve with kombu dashi (a broth), soy, sliced spring onions and shichimi togarashi (a pepper/spice mix)... or whatever you like.</p>
