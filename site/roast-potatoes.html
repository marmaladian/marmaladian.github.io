<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>8 large King Edward potatoes, peeled and quartered
</li>
<li>fine salt
</li>
<li>100 mL vegetable oil
</li>
<li>sea salt, to serve
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Put potatoes in saucepan, cover with cold water and add 1.5 tsp of fine salt. Cover and bring to the boil over a
</p>
<p>high heat, then turn down to medium. Simmer gently for 15 minutes until the potatoes are almost quick - the tip
</p>
<p>of a small, sharp knife should go in easily without breaking the potato up.
</p>
<p>Heat oven to 200 C (fan). Drain the potatoes and shake well, leaving them to dry out for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a roasting pan in the oven until very hot.
</p>
<p>Place potatoes one by one into the oil. Season with a pinch of fine salt and turn until coated, then return the pan
</p>
<p>to the oven.
</p>
<p>Roast the potatoes for 30-40 minutes, turning them every 10 minutes and sprinkling them with sea salt about halfway
</p>
<p>through when they're starting to colour.
</p>
<p>Remove and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
