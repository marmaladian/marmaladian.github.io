       <h1>Roast potatoes</h1>
 <p>by Marcus Wareing</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
<li>8 large King Edward potatoes, peeled and quartered</li> <li>fine salt</li> <li>100 mL vegetable oil</li> <li>sea salt, to serve</li> </ul>
 <h2>Method</h2>
 <p>Put potatoes in saucepan, cover with cold water and add 1.5 tsp of fine salt. Cover and bring to the boil over a high heat, then turn down to medium. Simmer gently for 15 minutes until the potatoes are almost quick - the tip of a small, sharp knife should go in easily without breaking the potato up.</p>
 <p>Heat oven to 200 C (fan). Drain the potatoes and shake well, leaving them to dry out for a few minutes. Heat the oil in a roasting pan in the oven until very hot.</p>
 <p>Place potatoes one by one into the oil. Season with a pinch of fine salt and turn until coated, then return the pan to the oven.</p>
 <p>Roast the potatoes for 30-40 minutes, turning them every 10 minutes and sprinkling them with sea salt about halfway through when they're starting to colour.</p>
 <p>Remove and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
