                    <section>
                        <p>This site was inspired by Arne's <a href="http://androidarts.com">Android Arts</a>, cly5m's <a href="http://autofish.net">autofish</a> and Devine Lu Linvega's <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com">XXIIVV</a> - sites that are continually added to and pruned away, gradually building up a fascinating repository of their thoughts, art and explorations. I've since heard the term digital garden used to describe this sort of site and like it very much.
</p>
<p>The site is completely static and the pages are generated from text files using a simple custom markup. The generator (<i>Pipi</i>) is currently written in Java, but will continue to be rewritten in new languages as I study them at university. It has previously been written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">m4</a>, C and I think the original was Ruby. You can browse the <a href="https://github.com/marmaladian/marmaladian.github.io">source</a> if you are so inclined.
</p>
<p>The name <i>Park Imminent</i> comes from a fictional megacorp/zaibatsu I invented for a cyberpunk roleplaying game - a Korean-owned advanced technologies corporation... "Your future is our today."
