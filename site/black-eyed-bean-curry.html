                    <section>
                        <p>My friend Ryan described this as a revelation, "it's as though I've never eaten beans before".

<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>1 cup dried black-eyed beans
</li>
<li>1 medium onion, chopped
</li>
<li>vegetable oil
</li>
<li>1 tsp garlic paste
</li>
<li>1 tsp ginger paste
</li>
<li>1/2 tsp turmeric paste
</li>
<li>1 tsp dried oregano
</li>
<li>1 tsp chilli flakes
</li>
<li>1 tsp curry powder
</li>
<li>400mL coconut cream
</li>
<li>vegetable stock cube
</li>
<li>bunch of chopped parsley
</li>
<li>lemon or lime to serve
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>You can soak the dried beans in cold water overnight, but it's quicker to put them in a saucepan with 2.5L of cold water, bring to a boil and then turn off and soak for 4 hours before rinsing.
</p>
<p>Grating the ginger, garlic and turmeric is easiest with a Japanese ceramic grater, a microplane, box grater or even finely mincing them will also work.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry until sweating and softened.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Stir through the pastes, oregano, chilli and curry powder and cook for a minute or two. Add the beans, stir through to coat with the onion and spices then mix through the coconut cream.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cook for 10-15 minutes then stir through the parsley and season to taste. Serve with citrus.</p>
