</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Put couscous in large bowl and whisk with the hot stock. Cover tightly and leave for at least 30 minutes,
</p>
<p>whisking several times. Put raisins in small bowl, cover with warm water and leave to soak.
</p>
<p>Remove lemon slices, when cool enough to handle chop into small pieces. Drain the raisins and chop roughly.
</p>
<p>Fluff up the couscous, add about 1/3 of the chopped lemon with the raisins and pistachios, mix well.

<p>Marcus Wareing
</p>
<h3>Ingredients
</h3>
<ul><li>50g red kidney beans, soaked in cold water overnight
</li>
<li>50g dried green adzuki beans, soaked in cold water for a few hours
</li>
<li>30g Puy lentils
</li>
<li>5 tbsp olive oil
</li>
<li>1 Spanish onion (yellow onion), finely chopped
</li>
<li>2 red capsicums, finely chopped
</li>
<li>2 hot red chillies, finely chopped
</li>
<li>2 tsp chilli powder
</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</li>
<li>300g ripe tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and chopped (or 400g can of chopped tomatoes)
</li>
<li>500mL tomato juice
</li>
<li>leaves of 1 bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method
</h3>
<p>Blanch (bring to boil over high heat from cold, then drain under cold water immediately) the kidney beans,
</p>
<p>then return to pain with cold water and bring to a 10 minute rapid boil to make them easier to digest.
</p>
<p>Half cover the pan, turn down heat and simmer for 30-45 minutes.
</p>
<p>Blanc adzuki beans and lentils separately, then bring both to the boil separately.
</p>
<p>Half cover and simmer until tender: 12-15 mins for the beans and 20-25 mins for the lentils. Drain and set aside.
</p>
<p>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add onion, capsicum, chillies and garlic. Sprinkle in chilli powder and salt,
</p>
<p>cook for 5 mins to soften vegetables. Add tomatoes, beans, lentils and juice and stir to mix.
</p>
<p>Cover and simmer for 45-60 mins stirring occasionally.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Stir coriander into beans and season.</p>
