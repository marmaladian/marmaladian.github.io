                    <section>
                        <h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>5-6 large tomatoes
</li>
<li>3-4 cloves garlic
</li>
<li>olive oil
</li>
<li>1 medium brown onion, diced
</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegan butter
</li>
<li>water
</li>
<li>2-3 tsp sugar
</li>
<li>salt and black pepper
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Weigh the tomatoes, then measure 2% of that weight in salt. A kitchen scale may not be accurate enough
</p>
<p>if it's only a few grams. Slice the tomatoes into eighths, mix through with the salt and place into a
</p>
<p>clean glass jar. Make sure you've got all the salt into the jar. Weigh the tomatoes down, for example - 
</p>
<p>you can use a fermenting weight, hessian filled with glass marbles, or another jar filled with water.
</p>
<p>Wait a few days, then start tasting the tomatoes every day to see if the flavour has developed - how
</p>
<p>quickly they ferment will depend on the ambient temperature. A week in winter was fine for this first
</p>
<p>experiment, but I'll double the time next.
</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and roast the garlic for about 40 minutes, until it is soft.
</p>
<p>Melt the butter in a saucepan, squeeze the roasted garlic from its skin into the butter, add the onions and
</p>
<p>sautee until the onions soften then add the tomatoes and cook until the mixture is soften. Blend or mash,
</p>
<p>then taste adding water then sugar to reduce the salt as needed. Season with cracked pepper.
</p>
<p>Serves 2-3.
