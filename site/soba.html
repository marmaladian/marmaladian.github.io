                    <section>
                        <h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<p>The weights here are relative to the water - e.g. if you have 100g of water, then you need 160g of buckwheat flour and
</p>
<p>40g of wheat flour.
</p>
<ul><li>160 % buckwheat flour
</li>
<li>40 % wheat flour
</li>
<li>100 % water
</li>
<li>tapioca flour
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Mix flours and water in bowl with your fingers until a stiff crumbly dough is formed.
</p>
<p>Knead until smooth then turn out onto a surface that has been lightly dusted with tapioca flour.
</p>
<p>Shape into a cone then press down so you have a thick coin with a flat bottom.
</p>
<p>Use a rolling pin to roll into a flat sheet, longer in one direction than the other.
</p>
<p>Dust the top with more tapioca flour and then fold the sheet in half across its width.
</p>
<p>Dust the top with tapioca flour and fold again.
</p>
<p>Use a sharp knife to cut the folded sheet into folded noodles.
</p>
<p>Get a large bowl of iced water ready. To cook, drop the noodles into a pot of rapidly boiling water for 60 seconds.
</p>
<p>Might need a little longer if your noodles are thick. Lift them out (using a strainer or cooking chopsticks)
</p>
<p>and drop them into the iced water.
</p>
<p>Serve with kombu dashi (a broth), soy, sliced spring onions and shichimi togarashi (a pepper/spice mix)...
</p>
<p>or whatever you like.
