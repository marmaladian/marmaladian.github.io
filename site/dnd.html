<figure><img src="../media/log/025.jpg"><figcaption>Player packs for my first D&D session</figcaption></figure> <p>Never played D&D as a kid and didn't really understand what it was. More recently I had a crack at building my own campaign <em>Second Spring</em>. After realising what an undertaking that actually was, decided to run the colossally large <em>Out of the Abyss</em> campaign.</p>
 <p>As you read this, the Triceratops Prudential lads are still stuck in the abyss. I really should run another session.</p>
