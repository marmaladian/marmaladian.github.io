 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
<li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li> <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li> <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li> <li>2 medium fennel bulbs, trimed, cored and diced small</li> <li>salt to taste</li> <li>1 cup long grain rice, or coarse bulgur</li> <li>2 1/2 cups water</li> <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li> <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill</li> <li>freshly ground pepper</li> </ul>
 <h2>Method</h2>
 <p>Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a pan or wide lidded saucepan. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in fennel, add a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until fennel has wilted and softened (about 8 minutes). Stir in rice or bulgur to coat with olive oil.</p>
 <p>Add water, salt, pepper, parsley and dill and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until rice or bulgur is soft and liquid absorbed (i.e. normal absorption cooking time for the rice). Remove from heat, uncover and place a towl across the top of the pan. Return lid and let sit for 10 minutes. Serve hot, with the remaining olive oil drizzled over the top.</p>
