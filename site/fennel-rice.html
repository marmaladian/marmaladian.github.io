<h2>Ingredients
</h2>
<ul><li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</li>
<li>1 medium onion, chopped
</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced
</li>
<li>2 medium fennel bulbs, trimed, cored and diced small
</li>
<li>salt to taste
</li>
<li>1 cup long grain rice, or coarse bulgur
</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups water
</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
</li>
<li>freshly ground pepper
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method
</h2>
<p>Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a pan or wide lidded saucepan.
</p>
<p>Add onion and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant,
</p>
<p>about 30 seconds. Stir in fennel, add a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until fennel
</p>
<p>has wilted and softened (about 8 minutes). Stir in rice or bulgur to coat with olive oil.
</p>
<p>Add water, salt, pepper, parsley and dill and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer
</p>
<p>until rice or bulgur is soft and liquid absorbed (i.e. normal absorption cooking time for the rice).
</p>
<p>Remove from heat, uncover and place a towl across the top of the pan. Return lid and let sit for 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>Serve hot, with the remaining olive oil drizzled over the top.</p>
