1 Telepathy
  Telepathy is a concept programming language/system.

" Far more than CorbatÃ³ himself had originally realized, his open-systems design for CTSS had deep parallels to the notions of free speech in a political democracy, free competition in a market economy, and the free exchange of ideas in scientific research. In each there is a core set of rules that everyone must accept to make the interchange possible at all. But beyond that, creativity reigns."
> The Dream Machine, p232.
