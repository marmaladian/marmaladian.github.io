2 Advice

  Everything on YouTube should be watched with a grain of salt. Everyone's putting themselves forward as an expert, but can there really be that many experts in the world? I was originally thinking this while watching calisthenics videos, but for other stuff it might be much more difficult to assess.

  What about general life advice and philosophy? Well, life advice you probably shouldn't take anything unless its from your elders. They've been there and know the consequences. Every other YouTuber is putting out "How I X and why" or "The Reason I Z" and to be honest who gives a shit.

  If you're a person who does X every day for twenty years, OK you might just know what you're talking about. But if you've just switched to a new keyboard layout or diet or productivity method... why don't you shut the fuck up for a decade and then tell us how it went? Obviously the priority is on producing videos, so that's not going to happen.

  Side note: made respect to the Geek Climber who posts videos about the 700 day efforts to learn a single exericse/technique. And still defers to experts.
