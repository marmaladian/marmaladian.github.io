                Y's parents are visiting; we went to the tennis with them and my parents.

                Japanese study is going well and I've been watching an episode or half of Ergo Proxy each night. Lot of jargon to pick up in the early episodes, but it's about 60-70% comprehensible now.
            <p>
                I was gradually increasing my running at the end of last year (after tearing a calf muscle) and it's going well. I ran a 30:00 5km last week, and I'm aiming to improve to 25:00.

                I also started learning how to make music in <a href="101-strudel-patterns.html">Strudel</a>.

                Spent Wednesday at DisneySea. It was cold, with light snow falling while we queued to enter. The fast pass system
                I remembered from my last visit (a decade ago?) has been replaced by a paid priority queue. So, we only managed
                four rides across the day. Last time it was more than fifteen! The loop on Raging Spirits was even smaller than
                I remembered, the drop on Journey to the Centre of the Earth remains exhilarating.
            </p>

                I got back to Melbourne on Saturday, unpacked a bit, and went for a beer with D. Sunday was quieter. I unpacked
                more properly and cooked a shio ramen with tomato and miso (very good).
            </p>

                I think my Japanese has gotten worse over the past year. I spent all my time studying for university. 
                I’ve restarted daily flashcards and will add some TV/listening practice as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven’t done anything creative or productive yet. The holiday started right after uni finished, and this has been
                the first chance to sit still for a while. I’m still unwinding.
