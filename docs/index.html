                        Spent Wednesday at DisneySea. It was cold, with light snow falling while we queued to enter. The fast pass system
                        I remembered from my last visit (a decade ago?) has been replaced by a paid priority queue. So, we only managed
                        four rides across the day. Last time it was more than fifteen! The loop on Raging Spirits was even smaller than
                        I remembered, the drop on Journey to the Centre of the Earth remains exhilarating.
                    </p>

                        I got back to Melbourne on Saturday, unpacked a bit, and went for a beer with D. Sunday was quieter. I unpacked
                        more properly and cooked a shio ramen with tomato and miso (very good).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think my Japanese has gotten worse over the past year. I spent all my time studying for university. 
                        I’ve restarted daily flashcards and will add some TV/listening practice as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I haven’t done anything creative or productive yet. The holiday started right after uni finished, and this has been
                        the first chance to sit still for a while. I’m still unwinding.

                <h3>MoveMemorE vehicle motion replay</h3>
                <p>For my Bachelor's capstone project, my team developed VR software that uses GPS and inertial data to replay recorded journeys. The software connects directly to the <a href="https://www.eight360.com">NOVA motion platform</a> to control its 360° motion, synchronising physical movement with the VR visuals to recreate the sensation of the original journey.</p>

                <p>These are some hobby and experimental projects in various states of completion. I work on them intermittently.</p>
                <h3>Fantasy computers</h3>
                <p>A series of fictional computers and video game consoles, each with their
                    own unique architecture and instruction set. I'm working on an emulator for the first of these now,
                    <em>Amulet</em>.</p>
