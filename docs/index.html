	<h2>25B</h2>
	<p>Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars.
	So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc.
	From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon.
	He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences,
	take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.</p>

	<h2>25A</h2>
	<p>The Fallen will continue to claw at the walls of our City unless we strike them down.
	Beneath the ruins of the Cosmodrome, in the shadow of an old colony ship we have located the House of Devils' Lair,
	and the High Servitor feeding them their strength.
	We must destroy this machine-god, and send their souls screaming back to hell. </p>
