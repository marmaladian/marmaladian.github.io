		<h2>25/A</h2>
		<p>The last couple of years have been stressful; so spurred by two
			excessive drinking sessions at the beginning of the year, I made
			my first new year's resolutions. I started going to the
			gym regularly late last year, and I'll use this holiday period to
			add some more changes for health - sleep, eating and meditation.
			I'm feeling excited about the changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also started some research for my minor thesis at the end of last
			year.
